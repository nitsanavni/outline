# Retro 3

Joel
- really getting stuck. makes Joel realise that using GUI environment, need someone who knows commands else takes a lot of time
- just trying to get something working took a lot of time
- glad we tried it but we spent more time on environment and doing simple things than to actually to TDD
- preference in future session would be to do red green refactor iterations and can use something lighter weight like cyber dojo

Sarosh
- Need more documentation - takes a lot of time when things aren't documented
- Setting up the environment always takes a lot of time, part of learning
- Learned a lot of commmands
- Differences when working with others - communication and lack of control 
- Overall, really good; learned more

# Retro 2

Joel
- Interesting, feel like getting close and learning things how the tool works on our own including select all/vim
- a little slow going, with yet to do first test, but feels like we'll turn the corner
- see if we can get a couple of tests through red/ green/ refactor
- due to diverse knowledge, propelled forward as everyone has something or else they can add
- Suggest:
    - Commit more frequently
    - Delete unused files

Diana
- sent notes on nit tool/nit_chat 
- a lot of cognitive load to learn new environment/how to interact with chat
- focus on learning tool, caused missing the retro notes

Sarosh
- Diverse thoughts - enabled us to work out different issues; e.g., colon before dp - tried with and without
    - In this case it took us down an incorrect path initially; this is one of the risks

# Retro 1

Joel
- +1 on all the things mentioned by Diana
- learning vim commands
- liked getting from demo to start using it
- right balance of knowing enough through the demo to use the tool
- helped that one of the environments was setup before we began
- very reasonable to setup the project environment

Diana

- thinks this is going well and amazed at how quick the gitpod setup was for all three environment
- what did I learn:
- - refresh my skills on vim
- - learnt about setting the API key
- - learnt about pip freeze > requirements.txt, which allows us to run the command pip install -r requirements.txt to install everything

Notes:
Pip freeze > requirements.txt
Captures a snapshot of all the things you have installed and
All of its dependencies and stores it into requirements.txt
Then in future we can

Sarosh
- Learned:
    - Got to see Diana's written notes - lots of details
    - GitPod - new tool for me; setup was easy in new environment
- Good to learn new tool (Nitsan's AI tool) and work with it
