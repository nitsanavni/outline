Diana

- thinks this is going well and amazed at how quick the gitpod setup was for all three environment
- what did I learn:
- - refresh my skills on vim
- - learnt about setting the API key
- - learnt about pip freeze > requirements.txt, which allows us to run the command pip install -r requirements.txt to install everything

Notes:
Pip freeze > requirements.txt
Captures a snapshot of all the things you have installed and
All of its dependencies and stores it into requirements.txt
Then in future we can
